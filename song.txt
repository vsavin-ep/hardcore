Helloween Lyrics
"If A Mountain Could Talk"

We hurt who we love, we destroy what we need
For profit we sell our souls
We're sowing disaster, the mess is complete
Resources will soon be consumed

Open your eyes, see the signs all around
Hoping fate will have mercy on all
Someday the next generation will pay
But one day, it's too late to regret

If a mountain could talk
It would tell us a story
To reign in love means
Just how to say sorry

If an ocean could cry
We would drown in it's tears
Dusk breaks to dawn
Which we cannot survive
Without love

Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Life is much too short to understand it
Don't even try

Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Don't fill up your heart with hate and anger
Give it a try

I know that things are going wrong sometimes
But then we need to get it right
I feel the pressure's so intense, sometimes
I know we need a change tonight
